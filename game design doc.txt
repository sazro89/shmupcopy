who is this game for?

newer players to the genre (they're the bulk of my testers)
    - also a tiny scene but could get into it with a good introduction
    - unlike a general audience, good faith newer players want guidance
    - they want to learn the actual game systems
    - this can build out and help them with understanding other games they go on to play

enthusiasts (i still want to design a cool scoring system and have systems meat on this game's bones)
    - tiny scene but very dedicated
    - pet issues
    - want a stiff challenge
    - preaches to the choir

general audiences (who knows what may hook other players)
    - huge scene but very hard to grab
    - very fickle in their desires
    - often clash with the first two groups

Basics are important
onboarding is important
    - helps players get into the rhythm of playing and practicing the game
    - could look into missions? progression?
    - late problem
scoring is important
    - important for enthusiasts
    - sequel / expansion / labels / arranges
    - late problem

difficulty
    - multiple difficulties / dynamic difficulty
    - ranking system
    - sequel / expansion / labels / arranges
    - late problem

goal: one evening game
    - lower end : make it past the first boss
    - high end : 1cc pretty early, maybe even on spicy
"i did this!"
"this was cool!"
"this feels way more approachable than i thought it could be"

questions
---------
- length?
    - i'd like to try for a multi stage game, lets say 4 levels with a tlb?
    - i think a good playthrough length would be about 15-20 minutes for a full run

- classic vs bullet hell?
    - this is a weird distinction but i'd be leaning more into the bullet hell side of things.  would be closer to ibara/ikaruga

- sprites
    - backgrounds
    - big sprites for big enemies
    - explosions
    - luckily we don't have the same kinds of space limitations as with pico-8 so we can make what we need.  our limit is cart space but it's a lot for how picotron does graphics

- how do we spawn enemies?
- how do we program enemy behavior?
- how do we make bullet patterns?


- gameplay
    - option emphasis, think like deathsmiles being able to sweep lots of a bullet type off of the screen
    - i want more option variety
    - i also want to have a different scoring system from deathsmiles
    - bombs
        - i do like how there were multiple "bomb" effects in deathsmiles
        - ibara bombs are my favorite, i would love to have that style of bomb in this game
    - scoring
        - hidden items (think bees) that require bombs to uncover
        - these items along with a pickup multiplier and how many of them you've picked up during the level give you a big score bonus
        - strategizing ways to maximize the multiplier is a big emphasis for scoring in this game

FIRST GOAL: figure out the basics!!!
i want to have a character that flies around, scrolling background and left/right shooting that feels nice

1. performance test
    - how many bullets can we even make?
    - how much performance does background eat?
2. scrolling prototype
    - how long of a level can we even make?
    - scrolling speed
    - we have to create our own tileset
3. weapons & movement prototype
    - can we make basic movement and shooting feel nice?
4. explosion prototype
    - can we make a juicy procedural explosion?
